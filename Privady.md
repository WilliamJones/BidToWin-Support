# Privacy Policy — BidToWin

**Last updated:** February 8, 2026

## What BidToWin Does

BidToWin is a Chrome extension that generates AI-written proposals for Upwork job postings. It reads job details from the current Upwork page and sends them to an AI service to create a personalized proposal.

## Data We Collect

### Data stored locally (on your device)
- Your profile information (name, skills, experience) — entered by you in Settings
- Theme preference (dark, light, or auto)
- Usage count (number of proposals generated)

This data is stored using Chrome's built-in storage API and never leaves your device except as described below.

### Data sent to our server
When you click "Generate Proposal," the following is sent to our backend API:
- Job title, description, budget, and required skills (read from the Upwork page)
- Client details (payment status, rating, hire rate — read from the Upwork page)
- Your profile information (name, skills, experience)
- Your selected tone preference

This data is used solely to generate your proposal and is **not stored** on our servers after the response is returned.

## Data We Do NOT Collect
- Browsing history
- Personal identification beyond what you enter in Settings
- Upwork login credentials or account information
- Payment or financial information (payments are handled by ExtensionPay)

## Third-Party Services
- **ExtensionPay** — handles subscription payments. See [ExtensionPay's privacy policy](https://extensionpay.com/privacy).
- **AI processing** — job details and your profile are sent to our backend to generate proposals. Data is processed in transit and not retained.

## Data Security
All data sent to our servers is transmitted over HTTPS. Local data is stored using Chrome's secure storage API.

## Your Rights
You can delete all locally stored data at any time by uninstalling the extension or clearing extension data in Chrome settings.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.
